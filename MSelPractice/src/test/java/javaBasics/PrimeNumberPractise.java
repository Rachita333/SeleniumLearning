		//Prime num is number that is greater than 1 and divided by 1 or itself only.
		//For example 2,3,5,7,11,13,17 and so on
		// we can identify prime numbers by dividing the num by 2 as if it divides than it is not prime no
		//example - 3/2= 1.5 so 3 is prime no and 4/2=2 it divides easily so 4 is not prime no
